/**
 * Deriche edge detector (often referred to as Canny-Deriche detector) is an edge detection operator developed by Rachid Deriche in 1987.
 * It's a multistep algorithm used to obtain an optimal result of edge detection in a discrete two-dimensional image.
 * This algorithm is based on John F. Canny's work related to the edge detection (Canny's edge detector) and his criteria for optimal edge detection:
 *  - Detection quality â€“ all existing edges should be marked and no false detection should occur.
 *  - Accuracy - the marked edges should be as close to the edges in the real image as possible.
 *  - Unambiguity - a given edge in the image should only be marked once. No multiple responses to one edge in the real image should occur.
 *
 * Deriche edge detector, like Canny edge detector, consists of the following 4 steps:
 *  1 - Smoothing
 *  2 - Calculation of magnitude and gradient direction
 *  3 - Non-maximum suppression
 *  4 - Hysteresis thresholding (using two thresholds)
 * The essential difference is in the implementation of the first two steps of the algorithm.
 * Unlike the Canny edge detector, Deriche edge detector uses the IIR Deriche filter.
 *
 * Using the IIR filter makes sense especially in cases where the processed image is noisy or a large amount of smoothing is required
 * (which leads to large convolution kernel for FIR filter). In these cases, the Deriche detector has considerable advantage over the Canny detector,
 * because it is able to process images in a short constant time independent of the desired amount of smoothing.
